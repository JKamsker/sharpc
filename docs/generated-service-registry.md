# Generated Service Registry

ShaRPC emits a generated service registry for every compilation that contains valid
`[ShaRpcService]` interfaces. This lets callers create typed proxies and dispatchers
without scanning assemblies for generated types.

## What Gets Generated

For a shared contract assembly like this:

```csharp
using ShaRPC.Core.Attributes;

[ShaRpcService]
public interface IChatService
{
    Task SendAsync(string message, CancellationToken ct = default);
}
```

the generator emits:

- `ChatServiceProxy` in the service namespace
- `ChatServiceDispatcher` in the service namespace
- extension methods such as `CreateChatServiceProxy()` and `AddChatService(...)`
- `ShaRPC.Generated.ShaRpcGenerated`, a public factory and registration type

The generated `ShaRpcGenerated` type registers the service with
`ShaRPC.Core.Generated.ShaRpcServiceRegistry` through generated delegates. No runtime
type scan is needed.

## Typed Factory Usage

Use `ShaRPC.Generated.ShaRpcGenerated` when you want a generic API that does not depend
on the generated proxy or dispatcher type names:

```csharp
using ShaRPC.Core.Client;
using ShaRPC.Core.Server;
using ShaRPC.Generated;

IShaRpcClient client = /* connected client */;
IChatService proxy = ShaRpcGenerated.CreateProxy<IChatService>(client);

var implementation = new ChatService();
IServiceDispatcher dispatcher =
    ShaRpcGenerated.CreateDispatcher<IChatService>(implementation);
```

This is the preferred shape for frameworks, plugin hosts, and sidecars that expose
`Provide<TService>(...)` or `Remote<TService>()` style APIs.

## Dynamic Factory Usage

When the service type is known only at runtime, use the non-generic overloads:

```csharp
using ShaRPC.Core.Client;
using ShaRPC.Core.Server;
using ShaRPC.Generated;

Type serviceType = typeof(IChatService);
IShaRpcClient client = /* connected client */;
object proxy = ShaRpcGenerated.CreateProxy(serviceType, client);

object implementation = new ChatService();
IServiceDispatcher dispatcher =
    ShaRpcGenerated.CreateDispatcher(serviceType, implementation);
```

The implementation passed to `CreateDispatcher(Type, object)` must implement the
service interface, otherwise the registry throws an `ArgumentException`.

## Runtime Registry

The lower-level runtime registry is public for advanced hosts:

```csharp
using ShaRPC.Core.Generated;

var proxy = ShaRpcServiceRegistry.CreateProxy<IChatService>(client);
var dispatcher = ShaRpcServiceRegistry.CreateDispatcher<IChatService>(implementation);
```

Normally you should call `ShaRPC.Generated.ShaRpcGenerated` from the service assembly.
The runtime registry is useful when infrastructure code should not reference the
generated namespace directly.

## Assembly Scope

The registry is generated per compilation. If a solution has multiple shared contract
assemblies, each assembly gets its own `ShaRPC.Generated.ShaRpcGenerated` type that
registers the services declared in that assembly.

When a registry lookup is requested and the service has not been registered yet,
`ShaRpcServiceRegistry` performs one targeted lookup for the generated registration type
in the service interface's assembly and runs its static constructor. It does not enumerate
all types in the assembly.

If the source generator did not run, the registry throws a diagnostic exception that
names the service interface and assembly and tells the caller to mark the interface with
`[ShaRpcService]` and ensure the ShaRPC generator is referenced.

## Bidirectional Peer Example

The generated registry is what allows `ShaRpcPeer` to expose a compact typed API:

```csharp
using ShaRPC.Core.Peer;
using ShaRPC.Generated;

var peer = await ShaRpcPeer.StartAsync(
    connection,
    serializer,
    builder => builder.AddDispatcher(
        ShaRpcGenerated.CreateDispatcher<IChatService>(new ChatService())),
    cancellationToken);

IClientCallbacks callbacks = peer.CreateProxy<IClientCallbacks>();
```

Both sides can use the same pattern over one duplex connection.
